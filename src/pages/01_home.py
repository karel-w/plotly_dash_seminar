                Hello, everyone! I'm Karel van der Weg, a fellow HDS-LEE doctoral researcher at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre and Institute for Bio- and Geosciences 4: Bioinformatics.
                My primary focus revolves around machine learning methods for understanding Proteins.

                During my work, I've come across a notable observationâ€”the data we work with is becoming increasingly complex.
                As researchers, when we explore new publications, we often find ourselves wanting to delve deeper into the data and understand the underlying processes.
                For instance, have you ever wondered why certain values appear on a plot?
                Typically, this involves navigating through supporting information, hoping to find the relevant details in a clear and structured manner.

                I believe that as a research community, we have the potential to enhance how we present complex information to readers of scientific papers.
                We've already witnessed some progress in the machine learning community, where interactive resources have allowed us to explore machine learning models with greater ease.
                My goal is to extend this development to the life sciences and, hopefully, to your specific scientific field.

                In this course, I aim to introduce you to the power of interactive graphs and dashboards using Plotly and Dash.
                By mastering these tools, you will be able to present your scientific data in a more intuitive and visually appealing manner.
                We will cover the techniques necessary to create captivating visualizations that invite exploration and facilitate a deeper understanding of your data.

                Joining this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills to bridge the gap between complex data and effective communication.
                Together, we will work towards enhancing the impact of your research by transforming it into compelling visual narratives.
